Prob 2:

IowaLiquorSequential:

    - Must have Iowa_Liquor_Sales.csv in the same directory

Prob 3:

    - Output of Hadoop program "Correlation.java" goes to "./test/CovidCorrelation/"

Data Generation:
    - Generate extra files of different size for "Correlation.java" by running "source gen_files.sh".
      IMPORTANT: In order to make larger files than original,
      copies of "us-covid-counties.csv" named "ucc-<record number>.csv" must be in your cwd.
      Files are lengthened/shortened by adding/removing lines to the original file.    

    - Must manually type different input file into "Correlation.java" to use it.
      "CovidCorrelation.java" has no command line args.
